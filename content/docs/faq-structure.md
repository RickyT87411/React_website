### Is there a recommended way to structure React projects?

One common way to structure projects is locate CSS, JS, and tests together inside folders grouped by feature or route.

```
FeatureA
  index.js
  ComponentA.js
  ComponentA.css
  ComponentA.test.js
  Helper.js
  Helper.test.js
FeatureB
  index.js
  ComponentB.js
  ComponentB.test.js
```
