### Is there a recommended way to structure React projects?

One common way to structure projects is locate CSS, JSX, and tests together inside folders grouped by feature or route.

```
FeatureA
  index.jsx
  ComponentA.jsx
  ComponentA.scss
  ComponentA.test.js
  Helper.jsx
  Helper.test.js
FeatureB
  index.jsx
  ComponentB.jsx
  ComponentB.test.jsx
```
