### How do I add CSS classes to components?

Import the CSS file in which the styles are scoped:

```jsx
import from './path/to/Filename.css';
```

Pass a string as the `className` prop:

```jsx
render() {
  return <span className="menu navigation-menu">Menu</span>
}
```

It is common for CSS classes to depend on the component props or state:

```jsx
render() {
  let className = 'menu';
  if (this.props.isActive) {
    className += ' menu-active';
  }
  return <span className={className}>Menu</span>
}
```

If you often find yourself writing code like this, [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) package can simplify it.

### Can I use inline styles?

Yes, see the docs on styling [here](/docs/dom-elements.html#style).

### Are inline styles bad?

CSS classes are generally more efficient than inline styles.

### What is CSS-in-JS?
