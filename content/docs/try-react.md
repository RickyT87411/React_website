Try React online or set up your local development environment.

## Online

If you're just interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on [CodePen](codepen://hello-world) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/new).

## Minimal HTML Template

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also [download this HTML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html), edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so don't use it in production.

## Next Steps

### Quick Start

- Head over to the [Quick Start](/docs/hello-world.html) section for a step-by-step introduction to React concepts.

- Try the [Tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html) for a hands-on practical example.

### Complete Development Environment

The lightweight solutions above are the best fit if you are new to React or just experimenting.

When you are ready to build your first application with React, check out the install guides below. These setups are designed to get you up and running with a great developer experience and are ready for production. They include linting, testing, and optimizations built-in; however, they require more time and disk space to set up and install.

- [Add React to a New App](/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html): Create a new app with a fully-featured starter kit.
- [Add React to an Existing App](/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html): Add React to a build system or a larger app.
